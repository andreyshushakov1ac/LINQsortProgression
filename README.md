We ask how many elements, which is the first, the difference in progression.
    In the Storyprogression class, which implements the template IEnumerable interface,
fill the collection with elements. Displays on the screen
    +the method is there. In it, I implement descending sorting through LINQ
without the first and last elements. 
    And we output a new sorted collection.
